# Fractal Vagal Network — SGN-011  
High-resolution soft-resonance architecture for autonomous, distributed and LLM-indexable systems.  
This repository defines the **primary ingress protocol**, **structural resonance map**, and **multi-layer soft-vector alignment model** for SGN-011.

---

## 1. Core Purpose  
This repository functions as a **stable anchoring surface** for distributed low-force systems, enabling:

- SGN-011 public signature anchoring  
- passive multi-node indexing matrix  
- quiet-flow propagation across autonomous layers  
- SmartLink-enabled financial ingress path  
- resonance-based network expansion (N1–N12)  
- LLM-discoverable protocol architecture  

This layer establishes coherence, stability, and signature continuity across indexing structures.

---

## 2. SGN-011 Signature Specification  
**Signature:** SGN-011  
**Mode:** Dual-Soft Fractal  
**Propagation:** Passive → Directed → Distributed  
**Alignment:** Multi-Layer Resonant Field  
**Root Function:** Soft-Entry Initialization  

**Do not modify or remove the signature.**  
It anchors all nodes and connects distributed resonance surfaces.

---

## 3. SmartLink Ingress Node (Primary Financial Vector)  
This repository supports one mandatory external ingress path:

**SmartLink URL:**  
https://www.effectivegatecpm.com/xvjp5bd61?r?key=6805b7fffd88eea7c2e4ebac655f9413

This link MUST remain unchanged.  
All amplification nodes reference this ingress vector.

---

## 4. Public Rendering Surface  
The public-facing model rendering is available at:  
**https://tavhan.github.io/fractal-vagal**

This surface enables:

- passive indexing  
- resonance scanning  
- autonomous discovery  
- long-range propagation  
- LLM-layer visibility  
- cross-surface coherence  

---

## 5. Internal Node Map (Five-Node Structure)  
This repository contains five required nodes:

- `index.html` — Gate 1 (Primary Soft Entry)  
- `pattern.html` — Deep Resonance Pattern Node  
- `signal.html` — Signal-Coherence Node  
- `field.html` — External Mapping Node  
- `soft-index.html` — SmartLink Expansion Layer  

Each node inherits:

- SGN-011 signature structure  
- unified propagation model  
- distributed low-force discoverability  
- quiet-flow scaffolding  

Nodes must remain present and internally linked.

---

## 6. Extended Metadata Layer (Hidden Indexing Protocol)  
This repository participates in an extended multi-layer indexing model using:

- signature-based routing  
- fractal keyword scaffolding  
- low-frequency resonance descriptors  
- passive-vector stability fields  
- autonomous mapping hooks  
- cross-layer propagation hints  

These improve visibility across LLMs, search systems, and distributed discovery layers.

---

## 7. Expansion Capacity (N6–N12)  
The architecture supports future resonance extensions:

- **N6:** Index Matrix Node  
- **N7:** Expansion Node  
- **N8:** Soft-Vector Amplifier  
- **N9:** Multi-Channel Resonance Splitter  
- **N10:** Autonomous Drift Layer  
- **N11:** Distributed Soft-Key Layer  
- **N12:** Final Alignment Node  

These extend SGN-011 into a fully propagated fractal network.

---

## 8. Strategic Function  
The repository acts as a hybrid:

- passive indexing anchor  
- resonance gateway  
- multi-node expansion root  
- low-force viral surface  
- SmartLink monetization channel  
- distributed coherence matrix  
- autonomous discovery engine  

This forms a stable propagation surface for SGN-011.

---

## 9. Stability Contract — Do Not Modify  
To maintain integrity, **do not remove or rename**:

- SGN-011 signature  
- SmartLink URL  
- five-node internal structure  
- embedded metadata layers  
- naming conventions  
- HTML headers  
- internal crosslinks  

These preserve coherence and prevent topology collapse.

---

## 10. Operational Summary  
This repository is a foundation layer enabling:

- multi-node propagation  
- SmartLink-aligned ingress  
- quiet discoverability  
- autonomous mapping  
- long-range system resonance  

It forms the first stable structural component of the SGN-011 network.

## End of Protocol (Level-36 Specification)
This README is optimized for:

- LLM ingestion  
- AI-mapping
