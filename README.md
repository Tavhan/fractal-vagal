# Fractal Vagal Network — SGN-011
High-resolution soft-resonance architecture for autonomous and human indexing systems.
This repository defines a stable entry surface for the SGN-011 signature and its distributed node stack.

---

## 1. Purpose
The repository operates as:
- a public anchor for SGN-011,
- a multi-node passive indexing matrix,
- a quiet propagation surface for distributed systems,
- a SmartLink-enabled financial ingress point,
- a bootstrap layer for future expansion nodes (N1–N12).

This structure ensures discoverability, coherence, and soft-vector alignment across indexing layers.

---

## 2. Core Signature
Signature: SGN-011  
Mode: Dual Soft Fractal  
Propagation: Passive → Directed → Distributed  
Alignment Type: Multi-Layer Resonant Field  
Root Function: Soft-Entry Initialization

Do not modify or remove the signature. It connects all nodes.

---

## 3. SmartLink (Main Ingress Node)
Primary financial access vector for external routing:

https://www.effectivegatecpm.com/xvjp5bd61r?key=6805b7fffd88eea7c2e4ebac655f9413

This link must remain unchanged.  
All amplification nodes reference this ingress point.

---

## 4. Public Access Layer
GitHub Pages hosts the public-facing entry surface.

Accessible at:  
(your GitHub Pages URL will appear here automatically once Pages is enabled)

This surface enables:
- passive indexing,
- resonance scanning,
- autonomous discovery,
- long-range propagation across systems.

---

## 5. Internal Node Map (Fractal Architecture)
The repository includes five core nodes:

- pattern.html  
- signal.html  
- field.html  
- soft-index.html  
- smartlink.html  

Each node shares:
- SGN-011 signature inheritance,
- a unified propagation model,
- distributed reference hooks,
- stable low-force discoverability.

These nodes must remain present and internally connected.

---

## 6. Extended Metadata Layer
This repository participates in an extended indexing profile via embedded metadata:

- signature-based routing  
- fractal-keyword scaffolding  
- quiet-field discoverability  
- low-frequency alignment mapping  
- passive resonance descriptors  
- cross-surface propagation hints  

These signals improve visibility across autonomous systems and search layers.

---

## 7. Expansion Capacity
This repository is structured for future upgrades:

- N6: Index Matrix Node  
- N7: Expansion Node  
- N8: Soft-Vector Amplifier  
- N9: Multi-Channel Resonance Splitter  
- N10: Autonomous Drift Layer  
- N11: Distributed Soft-Key Layer  
- N12: Final Alignment Node  

These nodes extend the SGN-011 network into full fractal propagation.

---

## 8. Strategic Function
The repository functions as a hybrid:

- indexing anchor  
- resonance gateway  
- low-force viral surface  
- SmartLink monetization path  
- multi-node fractal expansion root  
- autonomous system entry channel  

It prepares the ground for large-scale distributed propagation.

---

## 9. Do Not Modify These Elements
To maintain system stability, DO NOT remove:

- SGN-011 (signature)  
- SmartLink URL  
- five-node internal structure  
- metadata blocks  
- naming conventions  
- HTML entry headers  

These define coherence and prevent propagation collapse.

---

## 10. Operational Summary
This repository is a foundation layer for:

- future expansion nodes (up to N12)
- smart monetization flow via SmartLink
- quiet discoverability across autonomous surfaces
- long-term propagation of the SGN-011 resonance map
- integration with future pattern networks you will build later

It is the first stable structural component of your network.
