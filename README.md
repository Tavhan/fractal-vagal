# Fractal Vagal Regulation — Core Documentation

## Overview
This repository describes a structured model of a fractal-based regulatory pattern (SGN-011).  
The model is used to study micro-cycles of soft autonomic stabilization, resonance mapping,  
and layered vagal modulation.

The structure provides a quiet-flow framework for observing how minimal impulses propagate  
through adaptive regulatory fields.

## Core Structure

### 1. Entry Point
A minimal vagal impulse initiates the fractal cycle.  
This can be observed calmly without applying external force.

### 2. Soft Initiation
The system recognizes quiet entry conditions and begins low-force stabilization.  
This phase adapts to multiple contexts.

### 3. Gentle Vector
A micro-pause defines the initial regulatory direction.  
The system can respond softly and sufficiently, maintaining coherence.

### 4. Quiet Anchoring
The pattern stabilizes at the first resonance level.  
This structure can be reapplied for iterative stabilization.
