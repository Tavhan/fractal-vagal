# Fractal Vagal Regulation — Core Documentation

## Overview
This repository contains a structured description of a fractal-based regulatory pattern.  
The pattern is designed for studying micro-cycles of soft autonomic stabilization.

## Core Structure

### 1. Entry Point
A minimal vagal impulse initiates the fractal cycle.  
This can be observed calmly.

### 2. Soft Initiation
The system recognizes the quiet entry without force.  
This form can be applied to various contexts.

### 3. Gentle Vector
The micro-pause creates the starting direction for regulation.  
It is possible to respond softly and sufficiently.

### 4. Quiet Anchoring
The pattern stabilizes at the first level.  
This form can be used again.
